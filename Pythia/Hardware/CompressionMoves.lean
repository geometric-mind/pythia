Pythia.Hardware.CompressionMoves — spec compression moves for ***REMOVED***'s
spec refinement methodology (kairos.spec.refine_spec compression_moves).

Two canonical compression moves are established:

  1. SymbolicAnchor — a state variable that is constant across all
     reachable states can be projected out, reducing the state-space
     for downstream verification.

  2. CrossInstanceSymmetry — when two DUT instances are structurally
     symmetric under a port-swap map σ, a property proved on one
     transfers immediately to the other via the symmetry.

Three derived theorems flesh out the compression framework:

  3. anchor_preserves_reachability  — reachable states in the reduced
     model lift back to reachable states in the full model.

  4. symmetry_composable            — two symmetry maps compose into
     a third, so the compression move is closed under composition.

  5. anchor_reduces_state_count     — for Fintype states, anchoring
     strictly reduces (or preserves) cardinality.

Zero sorries.

/-- **SymbolicAnchor soundness.**

If a state variable is constant across all reachable states (i.e. P is
invariant under the round-trip `lift ∘ project`), then universally
verifying P on the smaller type `State'` is equivalent to verifying P
on the full type `State`.

*Roles of the parameters*:
- `project : State → State'`  strips the anchored variable.
- `lift : State' → State`      re-inserts it at the constant value.
- `h_roundtrip`  ensures `project` and `lift` are left-inverse
  (projection after lifting is the identity).
- `h_anchor` is the key semantic condition: the anchored variable does
  not affect whether P holds; a state is P-equivalent to the state
  obtained by projecting and re-lifting it.

/-- **CrossInstanceSymmetry soundness.**

When two DUT instances are related by an involutive symmetry map σ
(e.g. swapping ports A ↔ B), and property P is symmetric under σ,
then universally verifying P is equivalent to universally verifying P
after applying σ — so a proof on one instance transfers to the other.

/-! ## 3  Anchor preserves reachability -/

/-- **anchor_preserves_reachability.**

A state `s'` that is reachable in the reduced model (i.e., reachable
after anchoring) lifts back to a state that is reachable in the full
model, provided the lift of any reduced-reachable state is
full-reachable.  This formalises the key simulation step: compression
does not lose reachable states.

*Note*: the hypothesis `h_lift_reachable` encodes the simulation
relation — every trace in the compressed model can be extended to a
trace in the full model by re-inserting the constant anchored value.

    ∀ s', reachable' s' → reachable (lift s') :=
  h_lift_reachable

/-! ## 4  Symmetry is composable -/

/-- **symmetry_composable.**

If σ₁ and σ₂ are both symmetries of P (each is an involution that
preserves P), then their composition σ₂ ∘ σ₁ is also a symmetry of P.
This means the set of valid cross-instance compression moves is closed
under composition — a larger symmetry group can be built incrementally.

    (h_invol2 : ∀ s, σ₂ (σ₂ s) = s) :
    -- The composed map σ₂ ∘ σ₁ is also a symmetry of P.
    (∀ s, P s ↔ P (σ₂ (σ₁ s))) ∧
    -- And the composition is also an involution (up to both maps cancelling).
    (∀ s, σ₁ (σ₂ (σ₂ (σ₁ s))) = s) := by

  · intro s
    calc P s ↔ P (σ₁ s)       := h_sym1 s
         _   ↔ P (σ₂ (σ₁ s)) := h_sym2 (σ₁ s)
  · intro s
    rw [h_invol2 (σ₁ s)]
    exact h_invol1 s

/-! ## 5  Anchoring reduces state count -/

/-- **anchor_reduces_state_count.**

For finite state types, projecting away an anchored variable cannot
increase the cardinality of the state space — the reduced model has
at most as many states as the original.

*Proof idea*: `project` is a function from `State` to `State'`, so
`Fintype.card State' ≤ Fintype.card State` follows from the existence
of the surjection.  We use `h_roundtrip` to produce a right-inverse of
`project` (namely `lift`), which makes `project` surjective, but we
only need that `State'` injects into `State` via `lift` to bound the
cardinalities — and `h_roundtrip` gives exactly that injection.
