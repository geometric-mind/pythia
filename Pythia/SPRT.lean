Pythia.SPRT — Wald's sequential probability ratio test.

The SPRT (Wald 1947) is the foundational *sequential* hypothesis test:
two simple hypotheses

  H_0: data is iid p_0,    H_1: data is iid p_1,

observe X_1, X_2, … sequentially, maintain the log-likelihood ratio
Λ_n = Σ_{i ≤ n} log(p_1(X_i) / p_0(X_i)), stop at the first n with
Λ_n ≥ A or Λ_n ≤ B (for A > 0 > B), then declare H_1 if Λ_n ≥ A and
H_0 if Λ_n ≤ B.

Mathlib has zero formalization of SPRT. We ship four headline theorems:

* `SPRT.error_rates`           — Wald's bound on type-I error in terms
                                  of the (A, B) boundaries.
* `SPRT.wald_approximation`    — practitioner-facing form: choose
                                  A = log((1-β)/α), B = log(β/(1-α))
                                  to get error rates ≤ (α, β).
* `SPRT.wald_wolfowitz_optimal` — *the* optimality theorem: SPRT
                                  minimizes E[τ | H_0] and E[τ | H_1]
                                  among all sequential tests with the
                                  same error rates. structural.
* `SPRT.expected_sample_size`  — closed-form E[τ | H_i] in terms of KL
                                  divergences D(p_i ‖ p_{1-i}).

Status (2026-04-26):
  error_rates — CLOSED axiom-clean via Ville + continuity of measure.
  wald_approximation — honest-sorry: single-measure signature insufficient;
    needs two-measure extension (μ₀ + μ₁) + Wald 2×2 algebra. Sharpened

    characterization, inf-integral interchange. Sharpened in docstring.

/-- **Wald's error-rate bound** (the basic SPRT guarantee).

For any SPRT with boundary `A > 0`, under H_0 (data iid p₀) the
probability that the running cumulative LR ever crosses `A` is at most
`exp(-A)`:

  Pr_{H_0}(∃ n, Λ_n ≥ A) ≤ exp(-A).

This is the type-I error of the boundary-stopping test. The dual under
H_1 gives the type-II error.

Proof (2026-04-26, axiom-clean):
  1. exp(Λ_n) is a non-negative supermartingale (hypothesis _hExpLR_super).
  2. exp(Λ_0) = 1 (Λ_0 = 0), so ∫ exp(Λ_0) ∂μ = 1 (probability measure).
  3. {∃ n, A ≤ Λ_n} = {∃ n, exp(A) ≤ exp(Λ_n)} by strict monotonicity.
  4. For each N, ville_supermartingale_finite gives
       μ{∃ t ≤ N, exp(A) ≤ exp(Λ_t)} ≤ (∫ exp(Λ_0)) / exp(A) = exp(-A).
  5. Continuity from below (tendsto_measure_iUnion_atTop) lifts to ∞. -/

/-- **Wald's approximation**: the practitioner-facing form.

To get type-I error ≤ α and type-II error ≤ β, set

  A = log((1-β)/α),    B = log(β/(1-α)).

This is a corollary of `error_rates` applied symmetrically under H_0
and H_1, with the algebra worked out for the standard error-rate
parameterization.

honest-sorry (2026-04-26): The `≤ α` conclusion requires a **two-measure**
argument that the current single-measure signature cannot support. The
complete proof has three layers:

Layer 1 — Ville under H_0:
  `μ₀{∃n, Λ_n ≥ A} ≤ exp(-A) · (1/1) = α/(1-β)`.
  This is already available via `error_rates` + `ville_supermartingale_finite`.

Layer 2 — Ville under H_1 (the *dual* lower-boundary bound):
  Under H_1 the process `exp(-Λ_n)` is a non-negative supermartingale
  (since under H_1 the log-LR is a martingale with positive mean, so
  its negative is a supermartingale). `ville_supermartingale_finite`
  applied to `exp(-Λ_n)` and threshold `exp(-B)` gives:
    `μ₁{∃n, Λ_n ≤ B} ≤ exp(B)`.
  With `B = log(β/(1-α))`, this gives `β_actual/(1-α_actual) ≤ β/(1-α)`.

Layer 3 — Wald 2×2 system (algebra, no measure theory):
  Let `a = α_actual = μ₀{∃n, Λ_n ≥ A}` and `b = β_actual`.
  From layers 1 and 2 and the boundary choices:
    a/(1-b) ≤ α/(1-β),    b/(1-a) ≤ β/(1-α).
  The unique solution to this system satisfying `a, b ∈ [0,1]` is
  `a ≤ α, b ≤ β` (Wald 1947, §3.3; verified by substitution and
  monotonicity).

Structural gap in current signature: the theorem has a single `μ`
(hypothesis distribution) and only the H_0 supermartingale. Closing
requires extending to two measures `μ₀ μ₁ : Measure Ω` and adding:
  `_hExpNegLR_super : Supermartingale (fun n ω => exp(-Σᵢ<n logLR(Yᵢω))) 𝓕 μ₁`
plus the H_1 integrability counterpart. The 2×2 algebra is pure `ℝ`
arithmetic once the two Ville bounds are in hand.

/-- **Wald-Wolfowitz optimality**: SPRT minimizes expected sample size.

Among all sequential tests `T = (σ, δ)` (a stopping time σ + a
{H_0, H_1}-valued decision δ) with type-I error ≤ α and type-II error
≤ β, Wald's SPRT (with boundaries chosen via `wald_approximation`)
achieves

  E[τ_T | H_i] ≥ E[τ_SPRT | H_i],   i ∈ {0, 1}.

This is the original Wald-Wolfowitz 1948 optimality theorem.

honest-sorry (2026-04-26): structural. The original proof appears in
  Wald, A. & Wolfowitz, J. (1948). Optimum character of the sequential
  probability ratio test. *Ann. Math. Statist.* 19(3), 326–339.
The standard textbook treatment is Lehmann & Romano (2005),
*Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 3rd ed., §3.7 (pp. 90–95), which
restates the argument via path-measure Radon-Nikodym and Bayes-minimax
duality.  A modern presentation using game-theoretic probability is in
Ramdas, Grünwald, Vovk & Shafer (2023), §6.

Three Mathlib v4.28 gaps block a kernel-checked proof:

  (1) Path-measure Radon-Nikodym derivative. The H_0 and H_1 path
      measures on `(ℕ → Ω)` arising from iid product extensions of
      `p₀` and `p₁` need a tractable `rnDeriv` chain identity:
        d(P₁^n)/d(P₀^n) = ∏_{i<n} (p₁(Xᵢ)/p₀(Xᵢ)) = exp(Λ_n).
      Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.rnDeriv` supports this for
      finite products but the *infinite-product* path measure requires
      `MeasureTheory.Measure.pi` + a kernel-based construction. The
      required chain rule for infinite products is not in v4.28.

  (2) Minimax characterization of optimal sequential tests. The
      proof reduces ESS-minimality to: for any test T with the same
      error rates, the expected log-likelihood ratio at stopping time
      satisfies E_{H_i}[Λ_{σ_T}] ≥ E_{H_i}[Λ_{τ_SPRT}]. This
      requires a minimax / Bayes-envelope argument over the class of
      level-α tests. The relevant tool —
      `MeasureTheory.Measure.integral_rnDeriv_le` or a sequential
      analogue — is not available in v4.28.

  (3) Inf-integral interchange for stopping times. The ESS lower
      bound is expressed as `inf_{σ ∈ 𝒯} ∫ σ dμᵢ`. Pulling the `inf`
      inside the integral over a tight family of level-α tests requires
      a dominated-convergence + compactness argument on the space of
      stopping times equipped with a weak topology. This is not
      formalised in Mathlib v4.28.

Industrial closure path: follow the constructive proof sketch in
Ferguson (1967), *Mathematical Statistics: A Decision-Theoretic
Approach*, Chapter 8, which proves Wald-Wolfowitz via Bayes risk
minimization + an exchange lemma. The exchange lemma (Lemma 8.4.2 in
Ferguson) is the key technical piece; it reduces the interchange in (3)
to a finite-dimensional convexity argument. Estimated Lean proof length:
~400 lines, requiring (1) and (2) as sub-modules first. -/

/-- **Expected sample size** in closed form.

Under H_0 the SPRT stopping time has expectation

  E[τ | H_0] ≈ ((1-β)·B + β·A) / (-D(p_0 ‖ p_1))

where `D(p_0 ‖ p_1)` is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and α, β are
the achieved type-I and type-II rates. The "≈" is exact modulo overshoot
at the boundary, which is `O(1)` in the small-error regime.

honest-sorry (2026-04-26): Three blocking prerequisites:

  (1) `wald_identity` (WaldIdentity.lean ~line 102) is sorry'd. The
      proof path applies Wald's identity to the centered process
      `Λ_n + D_p0_p1 * n` (which is a martingale under H_0 because
      E[logLR(Xᵢ)] = -D_p0_p1), giving E[Λ_τ + D_p0_p1 * τ] = 0,
      hence E[Λ_τ] = -D_p0_p1 · E[τ], and finally E[τ] = E[Λ_τ] /
      (-D_p0_p1). Once `wald_identity` is closed, this step is a
      1-line rewrite.

  (2) Missing boundary-exit hypothesis `_hExit`:
        _hExit : ∫ ω, cumLogLR S Y (sprtStop ω) ω ∂μ
                   = (1 - β) * S.B + β * S.A
      This is the statement "the expected value of Λ at stopping equals
      a weighted combination of the two boundaries, weighted by the
      (H_0) probability of exiting at each boundary."  Precisely:
      `P_{H_0}(exit via A) = β` (type-II error) and
      `P_{H_0}(exit via B) = 1 - β` (test accepts H_0 correctly).
      This is not derivable from the current hypotheses; it must be
      added as an explicit assumption. Proposed addition to signature:
        (_hExit : ∫ ω, cumLogLR S Y (sprtStop ω) ω ∂μ
                    = (1 - β) * S.B + β * S.A)

  (3) `wald_identity` itself requires the centered process to be a
      martingale (`_hX_mart_centered` in WaldIdentity.lean). Wiring
      this from the iid structure + KL hypothesis `_hKL` requires
      constructing the conditional-expectation identity
        E[logLR(Yᵢ) | F_{i-1}] = -D_p0_p1 a.s.
      for independent (not merely uncorrelated) increments. This is
      an `iIndepFun`-to-martingale bridge lemma, not yet in Mathlib v4.28.

Proof sketch once prerequisites close:
  1. Let `M_n = Λ_n + D_p0_p1 * n`. By (3), `M_n` is a martingale.
  2. Apply `wald_identity` at `m = 0` to get `E[M_{τ}] = 0`.
  3. Unfold: `E[Λ_τ] = -D_p0_p1 · E[τ]`.
  4. Substitute `_hExit`: `E[Λ_τ] = (1-β)·B + β·A`.
  5. Solve for E[τ] = ((1-β)·B + β·A) / (-D_p0_p1). QED. -/
