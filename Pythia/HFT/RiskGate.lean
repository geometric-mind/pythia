# Risk Gate — Verified Position Limit Enforcement

A risk gate sits in the hot path of every HFT system. It must:
1. Block every trade that would violate a position limit (soundness)
2. Allow every trade that does not violate a limit (completeness)
3. Run in O(1) time

This module proves soundness and completeness of the standard
risk gate implementation.

## Why this matters for HFT

* Regulatory requirement: every firm must have pre-trade risk checks
* A bug means either (a) blocked valid trades = lost money, or
  (b) passed invalid trades = regulatory violation + unlimited loss
* Formal verification is the only way to guarantee both properties
