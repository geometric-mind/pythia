# Latency Bounds — Verified Worst-Case Timing

HFT systems need provable worst-case execution time (WCET) bounds.
This module proves that common hot-path operations have bounded
latency: O(1) lookup, O(log n) sorted insert, and O(1) risk checks.

## Why this matters for HFT

* Tail latency kills: a single 100μs spike loses the race
* Proving O(1) means no hidden linear scans or allocations
* Proving O(log n) means no accidental O(n) degradation
* FPGA firms need cycle-exact bounds
