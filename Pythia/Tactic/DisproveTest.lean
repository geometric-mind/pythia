Pythia.Tactic.DisproveTest — regression tests for `disprove`.

Each example here states a FALSE claim under linear-real
hypotheses. The `disprove` tactic must FAIL the proof attempt with
an informative error that either (a) reports a Z3-found
counterexample, or (b) skips gracefully because the z3 binary is
not on PATH.

## Skip-if-no-z3 pattern

Without z3 installed, the tactic returns a `notInstalled` error
rather than a witness. Both paths are FAILURES of the proof
attempt: `disprove` never closes a goal. So a robust test only
asserts that the tactic does NOT close the goal, while leaving the
exact error text unchecked. We do this with a small helper command
`#disprove_must_fail`, which (i) runs `disprove` on a synthetic
goal and (ii) reports an info message if-and-only-if the tactic
threw an error. CI passes whether or not z3 is on the build
machine, because both `notInstalled` and the witness path raise an
error — the only failure mode is `disprove` somehow closing a
false goal, which would be a real soundness signal.

## Lean-gating

Every test elaborates against the kernel under
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (the Mathlib axiom
budget). No `sorry`, no skipped declarations, no axiom smuggling.
The witness Z3 returns is purely informational and never enters a
proof term.

/-- `#disprove_must_fail` — run `disprove` on the goal of a given
`Prop`-typed term and confirm that the tactic raised an error. The
command synthesises a fresh metavariable of the supplied type,
feeds it to `disprove` inside `Tactic.run`, and reports whether the
attempt failed.

This is the test harness we use in lieu of a `sorry`-based
"expected to fail" pattern: `disprove` must always raise, and we
record which raise (witness path vs notInstalled vs outOfFragment)
fired so a human can read the regression log. -/

the `notInstalled` fallback (`z3 binary not found on PATH`) so the
test still passes on machines without z3, where the tactic raises
for a different reason but we still don't want a soundness regression
where disprove silently SUCCEEDS on a true goal. The point of this
command is to lock in the "true goals get reported as VALID" contract
when z3 IS available.

If neither marker appears AND the message also does not mention
`not found on PATH`, the test fails loudly: disprove either raised
the wrong error or (worse) closed a true goal. -/

/-! ### Test cases

Each goal is FALSE under stated hypotheses. `disprove` must fail
with either a counterexample report (z3 present) or a
not-installed report (z3 absent). The tests check only that some
failure occurred. -/

-- Test 1 (`disprove_test_universal_le`): `x ≤ y` is not a theorem
-- when `x = 1, y = 0` is a model of the hypothesis-free body.
#disprove_must_fail (∀ (x y : ℝ), x ≤ y)

-- Test 2 (`disprove_test_nonneg_implies_nonpos`): under `x ≥ 0`,
-- the goal `x ≤ 0` is false; any positive `x` witnesses.
#disprove_must_fail (∀ (x : ℝ), x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 0)

-- Test 3 (`disprove_test_strict_chain_subtract_one`): the chain
-- `a < b ∧ b < c` does NOT entail `a < b - 1`, even though it
-- entails `a < c`. Counterexample: a = 0, b = 0.5, c = 1.0.
#disprove_must_fail (∀ (a b c : ℝ), a < b → b < c → a < b - 1)

-- Test 4 (`disprove_test_subtraction_breaks_positivity`):
-- positivity is not transitive across subtraction. `x ≥ 0 ∧ y ≥ 0`
-- does NOT entail `x - y ≥ 0`. Counterexample: x = 0, y = 1.
#disprove_must_fail (∀ (x y : ℝ), x ≥ 0 → y ≥ 0 → x - y ≥ 0)

-- Test 5 (`disprove_test_pseudo_squared_lower_bound`): the
-- statement `∀ x y, x * x ≥ y` looks tautological at first
-- glance (squares are nonneg) but is FALSE: pick `x = 0, y = 1`.
-- This is the classic "tautological-looking-but-false" trap.
-- The encoder linearises `x * x` with a fresh placeholder; the
-- LRA assignment finds a witness against the bare `x_sq ≥ y`
-- inequality even though the algebraic relation is dropped.
#disprove_must_fail (∀ (x y : ℝ), x * x ≥ y)

-- Test 6 (`disprove_test_boolean_predicate_over_reals`):
-- a Boolean predicate that LOOKS true but isn't. The claim "any
-- two reals satisfying `x < y` also satisfy `2 * x < y`" is a
-- false strengthening: counterexample `x = 0.1, y = 0.2`.
#disprove_must_fail (∀ (x y : ℝ), x < y → 2 * x < y)

-- Test 7 (`disprove_test_universally_quantified_falsehood`):
-- a flatly false universally-quantified arithmetic claim. There
-- are no hypotheses to relax: `∀ x, x ≥ 1` is false at any
-- `x < 1`.
#disprove_must_fail (∀ (x : ℝ), x ≥ 1)

/-! ### TRUE-statement regression tests

These cases assert that `disprove` on a TRUE goal reports the
goal-appears-VALID message instead of producing a witness. The
companion `#disprove_must_say_valid` command checks the error
message contents to detect a soundness regression where disprove
silently closes a true goal. Tolerant of the no-z3 fallback. -/

-- Test 8 (`disprove_test_true_reflexivity`): `∀ x, x ≤ x` is the
-- canonical TRUE statement under QF_LRA. z3 returns unsat;
-- disprove must raise with VALID / no-counterexample wording.
#disprove_must_say_valid (∀ (x : ℝ), x ≤ x)

-- Test 9 (`disprove_test_true_transitivity`): a textbook TRUE
-- statement: ≤-transitivity. z3 returns unsat under disprove; the
-- VALID branch must fire.
#disprove_must_say_valid (∀ (a b c : ℝ), a ≤ b → b ≤ c → a ≤ c)

/-! ### Minimize path tests

These tests exercise `disprove (minimize := <expr>)`. Because
`disprove` always fails, we use the same `#disprove_must_fail`
harness with a CLOSED objective expression (a term that is
elaboratable at command level without referring to locally introduced
variables). The minimize machinery is exercised: we check that the
tactic FAILS with either a minimize-path witness report or the
notInstalled fallback. The key property tested is that the tactic
never silently closes a false goal.

For objectives that reference the introduced variables (`x + y`),
the tactic correctly falls through to the QF_LRA minimization path
once the variables are in the tactic local context. These cases are
tested via a small inline harness `#disprove_minimize_inline` that
embeds the full tactic call directly in the test syntax to avoid
name-resolution limitations at command level.

Minimum values are verified analytically in each comment. -/

/-- `#disprove_minimize_inline_must_fail` — test harness for the
minimize path. Takes the goal Prop and a tactic syntax block that
contains the `disprove (minimize := ...)` call (with the objective
already syntactically embedded). Runs `intros` first so any
universally-quantified variables are in scope.

This avoids the command-level name-resolution issue that arises
when trying to pass the objective as a separate term: by embedding
the FULL tactic call in the syntax, the objective is elaborated only
inside the tactic context where the introduced variables exist. -/
