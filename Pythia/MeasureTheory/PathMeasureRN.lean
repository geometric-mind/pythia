# Infinite-Product Path-Measure Radon–Nikodym Chain Rule

## Overview

For a sequence of measurable spaces `(Ω_n, F_n)` equipped with σ-finite
measures `μ_n, ν_n`, the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the countable product
measure `⊗_n μ_n` with respect to `⊗_n ν_n` on `∏_n Ω_n` equals the
(a.e.) limit of the partial products `∏_{i<n} (dμ_i/dν_i)(ω_i)`,
provided these partial products converge in `L¹(∏ ν)`.

### Main results

* `finProdMeasure_rnDeriv_eq_prod` — finite-product RN factorisation
* `pathMeasure_rnDeriv_eq_tprod` — the target infinite-product chain rule
* `kakutani_dichotomy` — Kakutani's 0–1 law for equivalence vs singularity

Since Mathlib does not yet provide a `Measure.iInfProd` (countable product
measure via Kolmogorov extension), we axiomatise the minimal interface
needed.  Every axiom is recorded as a `sorry` with a named gap so that
downstream code can track when a Mathlib PR closes it.

/-- **Path-Measure RN Chain Rule (target theorem).**

Given probability measures `μ_n, ν_n` on each `Ω_n`, let `P = ⊗ ν_n`
and `Q = ⊗ μ_n` be the Kolmogorov-extension product measures.  If the
partial-product densities `L_n = ∏_{i<n} dμ_i/dν_i` converge a.e. and
the limit is integrable, then:

1. `Q ≪ P`, and
2. `dQ/dP = lim_n L_n` a.e.

Gap: `pathMeasure_rnDeriv`.  A full proof requires either:
  (a) the Kolmogorov-extension product + a Lévy-type 0–1 argument, or
  (b) a direct martingale-convergence proof via the backward-martingale
      representation.
