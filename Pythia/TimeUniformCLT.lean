The classical CLT controls a single fixed time. WSSR24 establishes a
*uniform-in-time* version: under standard regularity, a sequence of
standardised partial sums converges uniformly in time to a Brownian
motion in the Lévy-Prokhorov sense. The corollary is an asymptotic
confidence sequence (aCS) for the mean of an iid sequence whose width
matches the non-asymptotic CS up to an explicit slack term.

This module formalises:

1. `time_uniform_clt` — the time-uniform convergence statement.
2. `asymptotic_confidence_sequence` — the aCS construction.
3. `aCS_sharp_universal` — the WSSR24 sharp-constant claim that, in
   the limit `T → ∞`, the aCS slack rate matches the betting rate up
   to the universal constant `c_aCS = 1/(2√(2π))`. Removes the
   `σ ≤ 1` restriction in `Pythia.AsymptoticSharpness`.

Phase C / v0.3.0 deliverable. All theorems sorry'd until the
Lévy-Prokhorov machinery is closed (Mathlib does not currently
include uniform-in-time CLT — the underlying Lindeberg-swap +
Brownian-coupling lemmas have to be ported or proved here).

Given an iid sequence `X` with finite second moment `σ²`, the
sequence of standardised partial sums `S_n / √(n σ²)` converges, *in
the Lévy-Prokhorov metric uniformly in `n`*, to a Brownian motion
sample at time `1`. The classical CLT gives pointwise convergence;
the time-uniform CLT gives uniform convergence over the time horizon. -/

Proves the universal version of the c_aCS claim that the
NeurIPS 2026 paper currently states under `σ ≤ 1`. After this
theorem lands, the paper's c_aCS bullet upgrades to "all four
families pinned without regime restrictions". -/
