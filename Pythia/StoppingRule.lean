Pythia.StoppingRule — formalised stopping-rule primitive.

A stopping rule on a discrete-time filtration `𝓕` is an
`𝓕_t`-measurable decision function `decide : (Time → ℝ) → Time →
Bool` that converts a running martingale into a stopping time.
Admissibility (Ramdas-Grünwald-Vovk-Shafer 2022) requires the
resulting stopping time to satisfy `ℙ(τ < ∞) ≤ α` in real arithmetic
for every sub-Gaussian martingale and every stated coverage level α.

This module formalises these primitives in Mathlib style.
