# Tangency Portfolio (Maximum Sharpe Ratio)

The tangency portfolio is the portfolio on the efficient frontier
that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. When a risk-free asset exists,
every rational investor holds a combination of the risk-free asset
and the tangency portfolio (Tobin separation theorem).

For two risky assets with expected returns mu1, mu2, variances
v1, v2, and covariance cov, the tangency portfolio weight on
asset 1 (relative to the risk-free rate rf) maximizes:

    Sharpe(w) = (mu_p(w) - rf) / sigma_p(w)

## Main results

* `sharpeRatio_portfolio`       : (mu_p - rf) / sigma_p
* `sharpeRatio_nonneg`          : Sharpe >= 0 when mu_p >= rf
* `sharpeRatio_at_riskfree`     : Sharpe = 0 at w = 0 (all cash)
* `sharpeRatio_scale_invariant` : leveraging doesn't change Sharpe
* `tangency_dominates`          : tangency Sharpe >= any other
