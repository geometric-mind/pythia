# Matching Engine — Verified Fill Logic

The matching engine is the core of every exchange. It takes incoming
orders and produces fills. This module proves that fills are correct:
the fill price is between bid and ask, the fill quantity does not
exceed order quantity, and the engine respects price-time priority.

## Why this matters for HFT

* Exchange matching engine bugs have caused flash crashes
* Dark pool operators need provable best-execution guarantees
* Every fill must satisfy regulatory price improvement rules
* A formally verified matching spec is a regulatory asset
