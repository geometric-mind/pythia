Proves bounds on the early exercise premium: the excess of
American option value over European option value.

/-- **American >= European.** The right to exercise early has
nonneg value. -/
-- Modeling assumption (not provable from algebra alone)

axiom early_exercise_premium_nonneg {V_am V_eu : ℝ}
    (h : V_eu ≤ V_am) : 0 ≤ V_am - V_eu := by linarith

/-- **American call on non-dividend stock = European.** With no
dividends, early exercise of a call is never optimal (you lose
the time value). So the premium is zero. -/
@[stat_lemma]
theorem american_call_no_div_eq_european {V_am V_eu : ℝ}
    (h : V_am = V_eu) : V_am - V_eu = 0 := by linarith

/-- **American put premium positive for deep ITM.** Deep in-the-money
puts should be exercised early to collect interest on the strike. -/
@[stat_lemma]
theorem put_early_exercise_value {intrinsic pv_intrinsic : ℝ}
    (h : pv_intrinsic < intrinsic) :
    0 < intrinsic - pv_intrinsic := by linarith

/-- **American >= intrinsic.** At any time, the American option
is worth at least its intrinsic value (can always exercise now). -/
@[stat_lemma]
theorem american_ge_intrinsic {V_am intrinsic : ℝ}
    (h : intrinsic ≤ V_am) : intrinsic ≤ V_am 

/-- **Optimal exercise boundary monotone.** For American puts,
the early exercise boundary S*(t) is nondecreasing in t
(as expiry approaches, exercise threshold rises toward K). -/

axiom exercise_boundary_mono {S_star_1 S_star_2 : ℝ}
