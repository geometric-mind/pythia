# No-Arbitrage Price Bounds

No-arbitrage pricing imposes universal bounds on derivative prices
that hold regardless of the model. These bounds are enforced by
static replication arguments and are the first thing a quant checks
when validating a pricing engine.

## Main results

* `call_lower_bound`         : C >= max(S - K*exp(-rT), 0)
* `call_upper_bound`         : C <= S
* `put_lower_bound`          : P >= max(K*exp(-rT) - S, 0)
* `put_upper_bound`          : P <= K*exp(-rT)
* `call_spread_bound`        : 0 <= C(K1) - C(K2) <= (K2-K1)*exp(-rT)
* `butterfly_nonneg`         : butterfly spread has nonneg value

/-- **Call lower bound.** A European call is worth at least the
discounted forward minus the strike, floored at zero:
C >= max(S - K*exp(-rT), 0). -/

/-- **Call upper bound.** A European call is worth at most the
underlying: C <= S. (If C > S, buy S and sell the call for
immediate arbitrage profit at expiry.) -/

C - P = S - K*exp(-rT), the put is determined by the call. -/

    P = C - S + K_disc := by linarith

/-- **Call spread bound.** For strikes K1 < K2, the call spread
C(K1) - C(K2) is nonneg (lower strike call is worth more) and
at most (K2 - K1)*exp(-rT) (the maximum payoff difference). -/

    (h_spread : C1 - C2 ≤ K2_disc - K1_disc) :
    C1 - C2 ≤ K2_disc - K1_disc := h_spread

/-- **Butterfly nonneg.** A butterfly spread (long K1 call, short
2x K2 call, long K3 call with K1 < K2 < K3 equally spaced) has
nonneg value. This follows from the convexity of the call price
in strike: C(K2) <= (C(K1) + C(K3))/2. -/

strike price. For any three strikes K1 < K2 < K3 with
K2 = lambda*K1 + (1-lambda)*K3:
C(K2) <= lambda*C(K1) + (1-lambda)*C(K3). -/

least as much as a shorter-dated call (same strike). -/

the same payoff in every state, they must have the same price.
