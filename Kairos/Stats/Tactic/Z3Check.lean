Kairos.Stats.Tactic.Z3Check — Phase 1 of the cross-prover hammer
(ATH-633): the `z3_check` tactic.

## What it does

`z3_check` closes linear-arithmetic goals over `ℝ` by:

  1. Encoding the goal (and its hypotheses, when they are also
     linear-real facts) as an SMT-LIB v2.6 query.
  2. Shelling out to the `z3` binary via `IO.Process.run`.
  3. If `z3` returns `unsat` for the negation, asking Lean's own
     `linarith` to discharge the original goal.

## Architectural principle: Z3 is an oracle, not a trusted prover

The tactic NEVER closes the goal on Z3's verdict alone. Z3 is used
purely as a *ranking / filter oracle*: a quick check that the goal is
in fact closable by linear-real reasoning. The actual Lean proof
term is constructed by `linarith`, which builds its own
kernel-checked Farkas certificate. If Z3 says unsat but `linarith`
fails to close, the tactic fails loudly — this is by design and
serves as a soundness signal (the encoding diverges from the goal,
or the goal is not in Lean's linarith fragment, and we should not
silently trust Z3).

This mirrors the CoqHammer (Czajka & Kaliszyk, JAR 2018) discipline:
external solvers produce a verdict / certificate; the host kernel
independently reconstructs the proof. The Lean 4 kernel checks the
final term against `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` — the
Mathlib axiom budget. No claim escapes the kernel.

## Phase 1 scope (deliberate minimum)

Supported goal shapes:

  • Linear (in)equalities over `ℝ`-valued atoms.
  • Hypotheses of the form `a ≤ b`, `a < b`, `a = b`, `a ≥ b`, `a > b`
    where `a`, `b` are linear over `ℝ`-typed locals.
  • Goal must reduce to `Prop`-level linear arithmetic.

Out of scope (deferred to Phase 2):

  • Nonlinear arithmetic.
  • Quantifier reasoning.
  • `ℂ` / `ℕ` / `ℤ` goals (ℝ only — though `ℕ` / `ℤ` literals as
    coerced reals are fine).
  • Polyrith integration.
  • CVC5 / Vampire / E backends.

## Z3 availability

Z3 is invoked at *tactic runtime*, not at module load. The module
compiles and loads on machines without Z3 installed; the absence is
only reported when a user actually writes `by z3_check` and the
binary cannot be spawned. The error message points at
`apt-get install z3`.

The companion test file `Z3CheckTest.lean` only contains examples
that `linarith` *also* closes, so the regression suite passes
whether or not Z3 is on the build machine. The Z3 path is exercised
opportunistically.

## Driver

ATH-633 Phase 1. Phase 2 expands to nonlinear (Z3 + nlinarith),
Phase 3 introduces CVC5 / Vampire as alternates. The `z3_check`
name is final per Aidan's 2026-04-25 directive.

/-! ### SMT-LIB encoding

We encode a small, conservative fragment: literal real numerals,
real-typed free variables, and the binary operators `+`, `-`, `*`
(only with at least one literal argument), together with
`(in)equalities` over `≤ < = ≥ >`.

This is the negation we send to Z3:

    (assert (not (=> H₁ ∧ … ∧ Hₙ → G)))

so a `unsat` reply means the original implication is valid. Lean
then asks `linarith` to construct the actual proof.

Anything outside the conservative fragment trips the `none` branch
and the tactic skips Z3 entirely, falling through to a direct
`linarith` call. That fall-through is what keeps the tactic
trivially sound: in the worst case `z3_check ≡ linarith`. -/

/-! ### The `z3_check` tactic

Workflow:

  1. Read the main goal and its local context.
  2. Try to encode goal + linear-real hypotheses as SMT-LIB.
  3. If encoding succeeds, ask Z3 for `unsat`.
  4. Whether or not Z3 was queried successfully, ALWAYS try
     `linarith` as the actual proof.
  5. If Z3 said `unsat` but `linarith` fails: fail loudly.
  6. If Z3 was unavailable / out-of-fragment: fall through to
     `linarith` directly (worst case `z3_check ≡ linarith`).
  7. If Z3 said `sat`: report the goal is unprovable in QF_LRA. -/

/-- `z3_check` — Phase 1 cross-prover hammer for linear arithmetic
over `ℝ`. Asks Z3 whether the goal is valid in QF_LRA, then
reconstructs the proof via `linarith`. Z3's verdict is never
trusted in isolation: linarith independently certifies the proof
term against the Lean kernel. -/
