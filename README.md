Pythia is a Lean 4 library of formally verified results in applied
mathematics and computer science. It provides 701 sorry-free theorems
spanning probability theory, hardware verification, networking
protocols, programming language semantics, actuarial science, numerical
optimization, information theory, mechanism design, and distributed
systems. All proofs close under the standard Lean 4 axiom set
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

## Motivation

[Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) provides
over 100,000 theorems covering the foundations of pure mathematics:
measure theory, topology, algebra, category theory. These foundations
are necessary but not sufficient for applied verification work.

Practitioners in engineering and applied science rely on named results
that do not appear in Mathlib or any other Lean library: the KKT
optimality conditions for constrained programs, Hamming distance bounds
for error-correcting codes, MTBF growth rates for synchronizer chains,
starvation-freedom guarantees for congestion-control protocols, or
type soundness for policy languages. These are standard textbook
theorems in their respective fields. They follow from Mathlib's
foundations but require substantial domain-specific formalization to
state and close.

Pythia fills this gap. It depends on Mathlib for the underlying
measure-theoretic and algebraic machinery, and contributes the applied
formalization layer: theorem statements that match the form
practitioners cite, closed proofs, domain-specific automation, and
paired empirical verification.

## Domains

| Module | Theorems | Coverage |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `Pythia.Probability` | 352 | Anytime-valid confidence sequences (Howard-Ramdas, betting), Ville's inequality, sub-Gaussian and sub-gamma concentration, Bernstein and Bennett inequalities, optional stopping, e-detectors, Robbins-Monro and Dvoretzky stochastic approximation |
| `Pythia.LanguageSemantics` | 134 | Cedar policy-language type soundness and coverage completeness, Palamedes generator correctness (totality, support characterization, data-structure invariants for lists, trees, natural numbers, STLC types and terms, stacks) |
| `Pythia.Hardware` | 32 | k-induction soundness, bit-vector modular arithmetic, Gray code single-bit adjacency, FIFO pointer conditions, Hamming distance metric and detection/correction capacity, Singleton bound, CDC synchronizer MTBF exponential growth |
| `Pythia.Actuarial` | 21 | Pareto, Weibull, log-normal loss distributions; Cramér-Lundberg ruin, Sparre Andersen renewal-theory ruin, Bornhuetter-Ferguson reserving |
| `Pythia.Numerical` | 19 | KKT necessary conditions (Slater qualification) and sufficient conditions (convex programs, Lagrangian sandwich), Picard-Lindelof local existence, Lyapunov stability, Kahan compensated summation, Forward Euler local truncation error, IEEE-754 round-to-nearest, QR factorization, Weyl eigenvalue inequality |
| `Pythia.Bio` | 17 | Mass-action CRN conservation, phylogenetic likelihood, Lotka-Volterra, SIR threshold, Wright-Fisher, Michaelis-Menten saturation, PK/PD AUC + half-life, Hardy-Weinberg invariance, Kimura neutral fixation, SEIR R0 threshold, RCT identifiability |
| `Pythia.Networking` | 19 | Reno (AIMD) and CUBIC starvation-freedom under bounded acknowledgment, BBRv3 trace wellformedness + BDP cap (from the FMCAD 2026 starvation paper), SACK pairwise disjointness, DCTCP + RED marking monotonicity, AIMD additive-increase rate, Bellman-Ford non-negativity, QUIC packet-number-space disjointness + 0-RTT replay-resistance, CoDel sojourn-time bound, split-horizon termination |
| `Pythia.MechanismDesign` | 10 | VCG efficiency, second-price allocation, Vickrey individual rationality + truthfulness (2-bidder), Bulow-Klemperer corollary, VCG budget-balance counter-example, Myerson optimal reserve price (regular distributions), Condorcet winner uniqueness |
| `Pythia.Distributed` | 10 | Paxos quorum-intersection (canonical) + corollaries (no two leaders, prepare-response uniqueness), Lamport clock monotonicity + happens-before clock condition, vector-clock causality completeness, Byzantine quorum intersection, two-phase commit agreement + validity + coordinator-failure blocking |
| `Pythia.InformationTheory` | 5 | Shannon entropy non-negativity, channel capacity = sup mutual information, mutual-info nonneg via Gibbs (parametrized), source-coding lower bound (Kraft + Gibbs), data processing inequality (parametrized chain rule) |

All mainline theorems are sorry-free. Work-in-progress proofs live in
`Pythia/Frontier/` and do not affect the CI build gate.

## Installation

Add to `lakefile.lean`:

<!-- doctest: skip-reason: lakefile syntax (require), not a Lean program -->
```lean
require pythia from git
  "https://github.com/athanor-ai/pythia.git" @ "main"
```

Then `import Pythia` or any individual submodule. Mathlib is pulled
as a transitive dependency. Toolchain: Lean 4.28.0, Mathlib v4.28.0.

## Example

Ville's inequality for non-negative supermartingales, closed in one
tactic call:

```lean
import Pythia

open Pythia MeasureTheory

example
    {Ω : Type*} {mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω}
    {μ : Measure Ω} [IsFiniteMeasure μ]
    {f : ℕ → Ω → ℝ} {𝓕 : Filtration ℕ mΩ}
    (hsup : Supermartingale f 𝓕 μ) (hnn : ∀ t ω, 0 ≤ f t ω)
    (hint : Integrable (f 0) μ) {c : ℝ} (hc : 0 < c) :
    μ {ω | ∃ t, f t ω ≥ c} ≤ (∫ ω, f 0 ω ∂μ).toNNReal / c.toNNReal := by
  anytime_valid
```

## Tactics

Pythia registers twelve tactics into the Lean elaborator.

| Tactic | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| `pythia!` | Nine-rung hammer ladder (stat_simp, linarith, positivity, aesop, z3_check, cvc5_check, vampire_check, e_check, disprove). Returns the first successful closure. |
| `pythia?` | Same as `pythia!` with per-rung timing output. |
| `anytime_valid` | Ville-type bounds on non-negative supermartingales. |
| `stats_ineq` | Concentration and tail-bound inequalities. |
| `prob_simp` | Measure-theoretic rewriting (pushforwards, conditional expectations). |
| `z3_check` | Linear real arithmetic via Z3, reconstructed through `linarith`. |
| `cvc5_check` | Bit-vector arithmetic via CVC5, reconstructed through `bv_decide`. |
| `vampire_check` | First-order clausal logic via Vampire, reconstructed through `aesop`. |
| `e_check` | First-order clausal logic via E (backup to Vampire). |
| `disprove` | Counterexample search via Z3 satisfiability. |

The `@[stat_lemma]` attribute registers user-defined theorems into the
`pythia` dispatch surface, following the same pattern as Mathlib's
`@[simp]` and `@[gcongr]`.

External solvers serve as oracles only. Every solver verdict is
reconstructed into a Lean 4 tactic script that the kernel verifies
against `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. This follows the
architecture of CoqHammer (Czajka and Kaliszyk, JAR 2018), adapted
for Lean 4.

## Empirical verification

Each domain pairs formal proofs with a computational verification layer:

- **Hardware**: EBMC bounded model checking on SystemVerilog properties ([`tools/ebmc/`](tools/ebmc/))
- **Probability/statistics**: Hypothesis property-based testing, 10,000 draws per theorem ([`tools/sim/`](tools/sim/))
- **Networking**: telos multi-backend trace replay
- **Language semantics**: differential oracle testing across Cedar implementations

## Theorem retrieval

The repository includes a full-text search index over all 701
declarations ([`tools/theorem_index.py`](tools/theorem_index.py)).
Given a natural-language query, the index returns ranked theorem
matches and generates a minimal `.lean` scaffold with only the
required imports. The [Athanor SDK](https://github.com/athanor-ai/athanor-sdk)
exposes this as a programmatic API for automated proof agents.

## Axiom discipline

Every public theorem closes under the Lean 4 + Mathlib axiom set
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. No `sorry`, no added
axioms. Verify any theorem locally:

```lean
import Pythia
#print axioms Pythia.ville_supermartingale
```

Pythia is built on [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) and
[Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).
Networking proofs originate from the FMCAD 2026 BBRv3 starvation
analysis. Language semantics proofs originate from the
[kairos-cedar](https://github.com/athanor-ai/kairos-cedar) Palamedes
framework. Several measure-theoretic, hardware, actuarial, and
numerical theorems were closed with assistance from
[Aristotle](https://aristotle.harmonic.fun) (Harmonic).
