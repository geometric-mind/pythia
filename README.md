> *Aesop-grade automation for statistics in Lean 4.*

`pythia` is the headline tactic of a Lean 4 library that wants to be the
canonical machine-checked reference for the statistical territory Mathlib
does not yet cover — anytime-valid inference, sequential statistics,
empirical processes, stochastic approximation, and the cross-domain
results practitioners in quant / actuarial / physics / biology / ML reach
for. Like `aesop` for general math, `pythia` closes domain-specific goals
in one tactic call, backed by a registered lemma library, a stats-domain
`grind` simp set, and a published aesop ruleset.

This repository is the Lean library only. **No LLMs, no cloud, no fleet
machinery.** The library works offline against any Lean 4 / Mathlib
installation. LLM-driven autoformalization, multi-prover swarm
orchestration, and Aristotle integration live separately in
[`athanor-sdk`](https://github.com/athanor-ai/athanor-sdk).

The repo was renamed from its working title to `pythia` on 2026-04-25 to
align with the headline tactic. GitHub redirects preserve all old URLs;
no action needed for existing consumers.

## Install

Add to your `lakefile.lean`:

```lean
require pythia from git
  "https://github.com/athanor-ai/pythia.git" @ "main"
```

Then `import Pythia` (the umbrella module) or any individual `Pythia.*`
submodule. Mathlib is pulled transitively at the same revision; do not
bump independently. The toolchain is pinned to Lean 4.28.0 + Mathlib
v4.28.0 for Aristotle parity.

> **Note (transition).** The lake package, the umbrella module, and the
> internal namespace are being renamed across the v0.5.x cycle from
> `KairosStats` / `Kairos` / `Kairos.Stats.*` to `Pythia` / `Pythia` /
> `Pythia.*`. Until that lands, the legacy `import Kairos` /
> `Kairos.Stats.*` paths still work; new code should target the
> `Pythia.*` namespace.

## Hello, pythia

The shortest possible exposure to the headline tactic:

```lean
import Kairos.Stats.Tactic.Pythia

open Kairos.Stats

@[stat_lemma]
theorem nonneg_sum (a b : ℝ) (ha : 0 ≤ a) (hb : 0 ≤ b) : 0 ≤ a + b := by
  linarith

example (a b : ℝ) (ha : 0 ≤ a) (hb : 0 ≤ b) : 0 ≤ a + b := by pythia
```

Tag a theorem with `@[stat_lemma]` to register it into the `pythia`
lemma library. Then `pythia` closes goals that match — falling
through to Mathlib's standard `aesop` automation when no kairos rule
applies. See [`demo/`](demo/) for the 5-minute end-to-end walkthrough
and [`examples/`](examples/) for copy-paste-ready files.

## Roadmap: cross-prover hammer (Z3, Dafny, EBMC, CBMC)

Pythia v0.7.0 will ship a **cross-prover hammer** that routes
statistical proof obligations to the right external solver — but with
every closure replayed back into native Lean tactics, so the Lean 4
kernel always has the final word. No claim escapes the Lean kernel.

**Phase 1 (shipped — `z3_check`):** the entry-point tactic
[`Kairos.Stats.Tactic.Z3Check`](Kairos/Stats/Tactic/Z3Check.lean)
dispatches linear-real-arithmetic goals to a local `z3` binary,
reads back the `unsat` verdict, and then asks Lean's `linarith` to
independently reconstruct the proof term. Z3 is treated strictly as
a ranking / filter oracle — its verdict never closes a goal. If
`z3` is unavailable on the build machine, the tactic falls through
to `linarith` directly, so CI is independent of the SMT install.
See [`Kairos.Stats.Tactic.Z3CheckTest`](Kairos/Stats/Tactic/Z3CheckTest.lean)
for worked examples. Phase 2 expands to nonlinear (Z3 + nlinarith)
and adds CVC5 as an alternate backend; Phase 3 wires in EBMC, CBMC,
Dafny, and Vampire / E.

| Goal shape | Backend used as oracle | Why |
|------------|-----------------------|-----|
| nonlinear arithmetic over reals + transcendentals (sub-Gaussian, sub-gamma, Bernstein MGF chains) | **Z3 / CVC5** (SMT) | discharges in milliseconds where `linarith`/`nlinarith` time out |
| bounded-horizon Ville bounds, finite-time CS verification at fixed precision (b, s) | **EBMC** (k-induction) | exhaustively explores the state space up to the horizon; pythia lifts the bounded result to all horizons via induction |
| stochastic-algorithm reference implementations match the Lean spec (Telos pattern) | **CBMC** (software bounded model checking) | finds adversarial inputs separating the reference impl from spec |
| pre/post specifications on user-supplied tactics | **Dafny** (VC-driven) | extracts verification conditions; Dafny calls Z3; pythia reconstructs the proof |
| first-order goals over decidable theories | **Vampire / E** (ATPs) | mature first-order superposition provers complement SMT |

The architectural rule: external solvers are **oracles**, not trusted
provers. Each backend produces a certificate (refutation, witness,
counterexample) that pythia's reconstruction layer turns into a Lean
4 tactic script. The Lean 4 kernel checks the script against
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` — same axiom budget as
Mathlib itself. If the reconstruction step fails, the goal is left
open with a `Try this:` hint, never accepted on the external prover's
say-so. CoqHammer (Czajka & Kaliszyk, JAR 2018) is the canonical
template for this discipline; we adapt it for Lean 4's CIC.

This brings the *speed* of a heavy-duty SMT/ATP/BMC stack to a Lean
library while preserving the *trust* properties of the Lean kernel.
The same trick that made [Sledgehammer for
Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle/sledgehammer)
indispensable, applied to a stats-domain Lean library. Tracked as
[ATH-633](https://linear.app/athanor-ai/issue/ATH-633).

## Quick tour

Foundations:

## Versioning

Semantic versioning. The `Kairos.Stats.API` surface (the umbrella `Kairos`
module plus the public theorem names listed in the Quick tour) is stable
within a major version: signature changes go through a deprecation cycle.
Internal modules — names starting with a lowercase helper prefix or
declared `private`, plus everything under `BenchDefs` /
`AristotleT0T1T2Bench` / `NewTargetsStubs` — may churn on any release.
Mathlib revision pin is treated as part of the public surface; bumping it
is a major-version event.

## Axiom discipline

Every public theorem in this repository closes under the Lean 4 + Mathlib
core axiom set `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. No `sorry`, no
ad-hoc axioms, no `@[implemented_by]` shortcuts on theorem-level
definitions. Audit each theorem locally with

```lean
#print axioms Kairos.Stats.ville_supermartingale
#print axioms Kairos.Stats.hrStoppingRule_admissible
#print axioms Kairos.Stats.bettingStoppingRule_admissible
```

The full audit log lives at
`docs/axiom_audit.md` (regenerated on every release).

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Open an issue first to scope the change. All theorems must
axiom-audit clean (`#print axioms` reports only `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`) before merge, and the repo packaging matches Aristotle's
tarball convention so any reviewer can drop a contribution into a fresh
Aristotle worktree for a frictionless sanity-check.

## Acknowledgments

This library would not exist in its current form without
**[Harmonic](https://harmonic.fun)** and the **Aristotle** automated
theorem-proving system. Aristotle closed many of the hardest theorems in
this repository — including the Ville-supermartingale machine-check
(`d2755ea2`), the T3 Gaussian small-ball lower bound (`54614669`), the
T4 wealth-process martingale property (`ca5f0a75`), the deployment-design
trio (`4d9266c7`), the Type-II power-loss bound (`a03602a5`), the
Howard-Ramdas CS admissibility (`e0ca7af5`), the betting CS
admissibility (`82321bad`), the sub-gamma martingale + Bennett-Bernstein
maximal inequality (`f254e362`), and the PAC-Bayes Radon-Nikodym KL
divergence (`ff1832e6`) — all axiom-clean against
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

Several of those closures replaced sorry'd scaffolds that humans could
state cleanly but not prove without weeks of manual effort. Aristotle
reduced that to hours per theorem with full axiom-audit transparency on
every closure. The library is positioned, in part, around what is
*Aristotle-tractable* — the partnership shapes which territory we
formalize first.

The library is also indebted to the Lean 4 + Mathlib community
(particularly the `Mathlib.Probability.Moments.SubGaussian` and
`MeasureTheory.Martingale.OptionalStopping` machinery), and to the
`anytime-valid inference` research lineage (Howard-Ramdas-McAuliffe-
Sekhon 2021, Waudby-Smith-Ramdas 2024, Ramdas-Grünwald-Vovk-Shafer 2023,
Chugg-Wang-Ramdas 2024).
