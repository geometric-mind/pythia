A Lean 4 tactic library for closing proofs in probability and statistics.

Mathlib supplies the foundations: measures, martingales, sub-Gaussian
machinery, the optional-stopping theorem. Closing a goal still takes
the kind of by-hand chase that ends with measurability obligations,
ENNReal arithmetic, and a stopping-time induction. `pythia` is what
the standard automation (`simp`, `linarith`, `aesop`, `bound`,
`measurability`) looks like once you specialize it for statistical
reasoning. A goal like

```lean
example
    {Ω : Type*} {μ : Measure Ω} [IsFiniteMeasure μ]
    {f : ℕ → Ω → ℝ} {𝓕 : Filtration ℕ _}
    (hsup : Supermartingale f 𝓕 μ) (hnn : ∀ t ω, 0 ≤ f t ω)
    (hint : Integrable (f 0) μ) {c : ℝ} (hc : 0 < c) :
    μ {ω | ∃ t, f t ω ≥ c} ≤ (∫ ω, f 0 ω ∂μ).toNNReal / c.toNNReal := by
  anytime_valid
```

closes in one line.

## What it does

- Five tactics (`pythia`, `stats_ineq`, `prob_simp`, `anytime_valid`,
  `z3_check`) covering general stats hammering, inequality closure,
  probability normalization, anytime-valid Ville bounds, and SMT-oracle
  dispatch.
- A registry layer: tag your own theorem with `@[stat_lemma]` /
  `@[stats_ineq]` / `@[prob_simp]` and the hammers pick it up at
  elaboration time. The same shape as `@[simp]`, `@[gcongr]`,
  `@[bound]`. No fork, no config file.
- A growing theorem library covering anytime-valid confidence
  sequences (Howard-Ramdas, betting CS, vector + asymptotic
  families), Bernstein / Bennett / sub-gamma concentration, optional
  stopping for unbounded τ, and information-theoretic bounds
  (Bretagnolle-Huber binary, PAC-Bayes Radon-Nikodym). All public
  theorems are axiom-clean against `{propext, Classical.choice,
  Quot.sound}`.
- A Z3 oracle (`z3_check`) that reconstructs every closure into a
  Lean tactic script: Z3's verdict never closes a goal on its own.
  Same axiom budget as Mathlib. Pattern adapted from CoqHammer
  (Czajka-Kaliszyk, JAR 2018).

## Why a separate library

Lean 4 + Mathlib already has strong general-purpose automation:
`aesop`, `simp`, `linarith`, `polyrith`, `nlinarith`, `positivity`,
`measurability`, `bound`, `gcongr`. They close a lot. They stop being
useful right when statistical reasoning starts: the moment a goal
mentions `Supermartingale`, an MGF chain, or a stopping time, the
generic hammers have nothing to apply.

Pythia is the closure layer (Bernstein-shaped lemmas, Ville's
inequality, Wald identities, e-detectors, the four canonical CS
families) registered so a domain-specialised hammer finds them.
Tactics read like Lean syntax (`by pythia`), not like library calls.
Error messages match Mathlib's tone.

## Install

Add to your `lakefile.lean`:

```lean
require pythia from git
  "https://github.com/athanor-ai/pythia.git" @ "main"
```

Then `import Pythia` (the umbrella module) or any individual `Pythia.*`
submodule. Mathlib is pulled transitively at the same revision; do not
bump independently. The toolchain is pinned to Lean 4.28.0 + Mathlib
v4.28.0.

## Bring-your-own LLM (for the natural-language → proof flow)

This repository is the Lean library: theorems, tactics, and oracle
adapters. The natural-language autoformalization layer (English → Lean
statement, then dispatch to `pythia` and friends, then the
natural-language summary) ships separately in our SDK and uses your
own LLM API key. We never hold a customer LLM key.

The SDK reads one of: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`GEMINI_API_KEY` from your environment.

**Recommended model: Claude Opus 4.6 or Claude Opus 4.7.** The
autoformalization step benefits substantially from a strong reasoning
model. Opus has the highest closure rate on our internal calibration
set for the natural-language → Lean → tactic-dispatch path. Other
models work; Opus is the default we recommend.

Oracles (Z3, CVC5, Vampire, E, EBMC, CBMC, Dafny) are open-source and
run locally. The Lean kernel always has the final word: every
external-prover verdict is reconstructed into a Lean tactic script
that the kernel checks against `{propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}`. No claim escapes the kernel.

## Hello, pythia

The shortest possible exposure to the `pythia` tactic:

```lean
import Pythia.Tactic.Pythia

open Pythia

@[stat_lemma]
theorem nonneg_sum (a b : ℝ) (ha : 0 ≤ a) (hb : 0 ≤ b) : 0 ≤ a + b := by
  linarith

example (a b : ℝ) (ha : 0 ≤ a) (hb : 0 ≤ b) : 0 ≤ a + b := by pythia
```

Tag a theorem with `@[stat_lemma]` to register it into the `pythia`
lemma library. Then `pythia` closes goals that match: falling
through to Mathlib's standard `aesop` automation when no pythia rule
applies. See [`demo/`](demo/) for the 5-minute end-to-end walkthrough
and [`examples/`](examples/) for copy-paste-ready files.

## Tactics

Five registered tactics ship in the public surface:

| Tactic | Closes |
|--------|--------|
| `pythia` | shape-dispatching orchestrator: routes to `anytime_valid` / `stats_ineq` / `prob_simp` / `z3_check` / `vampire_check` / `e_check` by goal shape, then falls through to the `@[stat_lemma]` aesop ruleset and the standard Mathlib chain |
| `vampire_check` | first-order-logic goals via Vampire ATP + Lean `aesop` reconstruction |
| `e_check` | first-order-logic goals via E theorem prover + Lean `aesop` reconstruction (Vampire backup) |
| `stats_ineq` | scalar inequalities arising in concentration / tail bounds |
| `prob_simp` | probability-theoretic rewriting (measure pushforwards, conditional expectations) |
| `anytime_valid` | Ville-bound goals on non-negative supermartingales |
| `z3_check` | linear-real-arithmetic goals via Z3 oracle + Lean `linarith` reconstruction |

## Cross-prover hammer (`z3_check`)

`z3_check` dispatches linear-real-arithmetic goals to a local `z3`
binary, reads back the `unsat` verdict, and then asks Lean's `linarith`
to independently reconstruct the proof term. Z3 is treated strictly as
a ranking / filter oracle: its verdict never closes a goal. If `z3`
is unavailable on the build machine, the tactic falls through to
`linarith` directly, so CI is independent of the SMT install. See
[`Pythia.Tactic.Z3Check`](Pythia/Tactic/Z3Check.lean) and
[`Pythia.Tactic.Z3CheckTest`](Pythia/Tactic/Z3CheckTest.lean) for
worked examples.

The architectural rule: external solvers are **oracles**, not trusted
provers. Each backend produces a certificate (refutation, witness,
counterexample) that pythia's reconstruction layer turns into a Lean 4
tactic script. The Lean 4 kernel checks the script against
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`: same axiom budget as
Mathlib itself. CoqHammer (Czajka & Kaliszyk, JAR 2018) is the
canonical template for this discipline; we adapt it for Lean 4's CIC.

`pythia` orchestrates a small pool of OSS oracles by goal shape:
linear-real to Z3/CVC5, bit-vector to CVC5, hardware-assertion to
EBMC, software-invariant to CBMC, first-order to Vampire/E,
Hoare-triple to Dafny. The full goal-shape dispatch table lives in
[`docs/sledgehammer_dispatch.md`](docs/sledgehammer_dispatch.md).

## Versioning

Semantic versioning. The `Pythia.API` surface (the umbrella `Pythia`
module plus the public theorem names listed in the Quick tour) is stable
within a major version: signature changes go through a deprecation cycle.
Internal modules: names starting with a lowercase helper prefix or
declared `private`: may churn on any release. Mathlib revision pin is
treated as part of the public surface; bumping it is a major-version
event.

## Axiom discipline

Every public theorem in this repository closes under the Lean 4 + Mathlib
core axiom set `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. No `sorry`, no
ad-hoc axioms, no `@[implemented_by]` shortcuts on theorem-level
definitions. Audit each theorem locally with

```lean
#print axioms Pythia.ville_supermartingale
#print axioms Pythia.hrStoppingRule_admissible
#print axioms Pythia.bettingStoppingRule_admissible
```

The full audit log lives at
`docs/axiom_audit.md` (regenerated on every release).

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Open an issue first to scope the change. All theorems must
axiom-audit clean (`#print axioms` reports only `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`) before merge.

## Acknowledgments

The library is built on the Lean 4 + Mathlib community, particularly the
`Mathlib.Probability.Moments.SubGaussian` and
`MeasureTheory.Martingale.OptionalStopping` machinery. Theorems trace
to the anytime-valid inference research lineage (Howard-Ramdas-
McAuliffe-Sekhon 2021, Waudby-Smith-Ramdas 2024, Ramdas-Grünwald-Vovk-
Shafer 2023, Chugg-Wang-Ramdas 2024) and to the broader concentration
inequality + matrix probability lines cited inline. All public theorems
are axiom-clean against `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.
